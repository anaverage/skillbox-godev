Let's complicate the task of drawing: try to bring out a Christmas tree. 
Print one asterisk in the first line, two more in the second, two more in the third, and so on up to the number of lines specified by the user.
Rules for the output of the Christmas tree: it is symmetrical, the number of lines corresponds to the one entered by the user.
It is necessary to print spaces first, and then asterisks. 
See how the number of spaces and asterisks in each line is related to the number of lines entered and the number of the current line. 
Inside the loop on the lines, most likely, two cycles will be needed: one for the output of spaces, the second for the output of asterisks.

Example of how the program works:

Enter the height of the Christmas tree:
5
     *
    ***
   *****
  *******
 *********
