Quite often, when transferring over a network or storing large amounts of data, you have to choose a type with a minimum memory size in order to save traffic or disk space. 
Write a program in which the user enters two numbers (int16), and the program outputs the minimum data type in which the result of multiplying these numbers can be stored.
Note that the positive result can be stored in a smaller type by using uint8, uint16. 
To avoid problems with overflow during multiplication, read the numbers in int16, and before multiplying, translate them into int32.

Check with examples:

1 1 result of uint8

1 -1 int8 result

640 100 result uint16

-640 100 int32 result

3000 3000 result uint32

-3000 3000 int32 result
