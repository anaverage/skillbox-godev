Write a program that solves quadratic equations. The user enters the coefficients a, b and c of the quadratic equation. 
The program should derive the roots of the equation. To solve the equation , it is necessary:

Calculate the discriminant by the formula: D = (b × b − 4 × a × c)

If D > 0, there will be two different roots that are found by the formula.
If D = 0, there will be one root, which is found by the formula.
If D < 0, then output that there are no roots.
Use float64 type variables.

To square use the math.Pow function.
To calculate the square root, use the math.Sqrt function.
