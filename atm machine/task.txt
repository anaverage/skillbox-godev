The ATM only issues banknotes with a face value of 100 rubles, and the maximum withdrawal amount is 100,000 rubles. 
Write a program that checks the validity of the amount of funds entered by the user. 
If the withdrawal amount is available, inform "The operation has been successfully completed", otherwise indicate the reason why it is impossible to perform the operation.

Example of how the program works:

Enter the withdrawal amount from the account:
500
The operation was successfully completed.
You have withdrawn 500 rubles
