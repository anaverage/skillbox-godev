Due to the peculiarities of storing fractional numbers, they are not very suitable for storing monetary values (a significant part may be lost when overflowing, and a fractional part of more than two characters is not needed). 
But we will try to solve the problem of calculating interest using them. 
Let the user enter the amount he puts in the bank, the monthly capitalization percentage and the number of years during which the deposit will be opened.
It is necessary to recalculate the amount monthly, rounding it down to a whole number of kopecks. 
For example, if after interest accrual the balance includes 35.78 kopecks, then we leave only 35 kopecks, and discard the fractional part. 
At the end of the program, it is necessary to withdraw what amount the depositor will receive and what amount will be credited to the bank by rounding kopecks.
