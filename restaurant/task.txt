Write a program that requests the day of the week, the number of guests and the amount of the check and calculates the amount to be paid. 
The following rules apply in the restaurant:

on Mondays, a 10% discount should be applied to all menus, because Monday is a hard day;
on Fridays, if the amount of the check exceeds 10,000 rubles, an additional discount of 5% is included;
if the number of guests in one company exceeds five people, a 10% service surcharge is automatically included.

Example of how the program works:

Enter the day of the week:
5
Enter the number of guests:
7
Enter the amount of the check:
12000
Discount on Fridays: 600
Service allowance: 1200
Amount to be paid: 12600
